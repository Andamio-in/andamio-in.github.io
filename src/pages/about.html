            <p>
              Andamio is a collaboration platform where producers from different backgrounds can be found, generating long distance projects. Sound is the basic element that we understand as image and text at the same time. The raw material of andamio is the confrontation of these codes, apparently contradictory but that share narratives, both in construction and production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andamio works within three lines: production, research and education. All are related not only to the union and develop of sound in other disciplines, but also in the use of different technologies to produce experiences. Such experiences are shared through our memories, forming constantly mutating narratives. Collaboration is an axis of work in Andamio, even-though we have people that constantly work in the projects, Andamio also seeks to work with other producers that can provide alternative perspectives.
