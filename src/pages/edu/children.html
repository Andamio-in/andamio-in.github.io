        <h5>About</h5>
        <p>
            Educational projects with children ground on audiovisual practices and their connection with collective storytelling and storysharing. Here, texts, sounds, and visuals come together to expand literary and poetic texts.
            <br>
            Children can see step by step the construction of each of the elements: the body as the main generator of sound, the text that is integrated, where the words also contain a sonic and visual layers, or everything that is around of us when you read.
        </p>

        <h5>
          Metodology
        </h5>
        <p>
          Practice-based, the children collectively experiment with these elements to produce something together. From this perspective, listening, moving, and doing is a continuum of activities carried out during the workshop so that the children build their own interpretations and appropriate what they consider significant. We end with the presentation of a reading accompanied by audiovisual production that expand the child's way of approaching the digital.
