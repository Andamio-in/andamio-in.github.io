        <h5>About_</h5>
        <p>
          A program of virtual Quebec-Mexico co-creation workshops in digital literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Montreal based artist <a href="https://www.agencetopo.qc.ca">center TOPO</a> joined forces with the artistic collective andamio.in and the <a href="https://centroculturadigital.mx/">Centro de Cultura Digital (CCD)</a> of Mexico City to launch a collective creation initiative in digital literature, the incubator of digital literature (ILINU). This formation and diffusion program in digital arts and literature was planned for a cohort of 20 Quebec and Mexican artists. Its objective was to develop the practice of writers, artists and coders through an exchange and learning program in digital creation.

          <h5>About the activities_</h5>
          <p>
              ILINU began with a tour of digital literature in the Americas, as well as an introductory presentation by CCD and its publication spaces and projects around Digital Literature and Arts. Then, under the direction of the artistic collective andamio.in, a collective discussion activity continued around performance practices in digital literature, followed by a series of creation workshops. In these, various audiovisual and literary creation strategies were experimented with: hypermedia collage, sound creation, creative programming, generation of dynamic content, web platforms, etc.
              <br>
              After this initial program of meetings, the participants continued with the collaborative projects with the support of the trainers. A virtual staging of creative projects gradually came online using Mozilla's hubs platform..
