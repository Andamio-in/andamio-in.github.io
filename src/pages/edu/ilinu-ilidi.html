        <h5>About_</h5>
        <p>
          A program of virtual Quebec-Mexico co-creation workshops in digital literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Montreal based artist <a href="https://www.agencetopo.qc.ca">center TOPO</a> has joined forces with the artistic collective andamio.in and the <a href="https://centroculturadigital.mx/">Centro de Cultura Digital (CCD)</a> of Mexico City to launch a collective creation initiative in digital literature, the incubator of digital literature (ILINU). This formation and diffusion program in digital arts and literature is planned for a cohort of 20 Quebec and Mexican artists. Its objective is to develop the practice of writers, artists and coders through an exchange and learning program in digital creation.

        <h5>
          Call for participation for 10 artists from Quebec & 10 artists from Mexico.
        </h5>
        <p>
            The first part of this program will take place from the end of April to the end of May 2022 and consists of 8 free online workshops, made possible through the Quebec-Mexico 2021-2023 cooperation agreement of the Quebec Ministry of Culture and Communications. The program includes two group discussion meetings and six co-creation workshops that will lead to an accompaniment program for dissemination in Quebec and Mexico with the selected projects
            <br>
            The ILINU will begin with an overview of digital literature in the Americas by the CCD, a space for the dissemination and presentation of digital arts. Then, under the direction of the artistic collective Andamio, we will continue with a collective discussion activity around performance practices in digital literature. This will be followed by a series of collective creation workshops that will allow for experimentation using various audiovisual and literary strategies: hyper-media collage, sound creation, creative coding, dynamic content generation, etc.
            <br>
            Following this first program of meetings, the artists will continue the collaboration with the support of the instructors, in preparation for the second phase of ILINU, which will focus on dissemination. A virtual staging of the creative projects will progressively be put online through the Mozilla hubs collaborative platform. A program of activities in physical space, between Mexico and Quebec, is also planned for 2022 and 2023.
