        <h5>About_</h5>
        <p>
            Andamio is a collaborative project that includes producers working with visuals, music, and text from different perspectives. Besides producing art, we have systematized our artistic methods by designing and facilitating a series of workshops where we share our experiences, both theoretical and practical.
            <br><br>
            All workshops focus on <strong>digital literacy and informal education</strong>: workshops, collaborative discussions, artistic encounters, etc. In these terms, we have facilitated workshops around electronic literature, creative coding, visual-music, audio-visual creation, among others. Working with analog, electrical and digital systems.
            <br><br>
            The following sections contain information about educational projects that we facilitated with kids and young adults. If you are interested in us facilitating a workshop, please contact our member Jessica Rodrguez (jac307@gmail.com). We offer workshops in both Spanish and English.
